Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. *It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.*

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?  
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?  
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?  
* How would you describe your work style?  
* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?  
* Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?  
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?  
- Setting direction with our Trello board and timeline, collaborate over Slack or in person.

- Bring everyone's attention to said obstacle and collaborate to solve the problem.  
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?  
- We have the tools set in place to do our best work.  
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?  
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?  
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
